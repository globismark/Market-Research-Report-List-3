<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Variable Valve Timing(VVT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Discrete (Stepped) Adjustment</li><li>Continuous (Infinite) Adjustment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Variable Valve Timing (VVT) systems can be classified into two main types: discrete (stepped) adjustment and continuous (infinite) adjustment. Discrete adjustment involves the system changing valve timing in steps or increments, offering a limited number of fixed settings. On the other hand, continuous adjustment allows for a more precise and infinite range of valve timing adjustments, providing more flexibility in optimizing engine performance and fuel efficiency. Both types of VVT systems aim to enhance engine efficiency and power output by adjusting valve timing based on driving conditions.</p></p>
