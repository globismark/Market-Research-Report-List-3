<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Darkening (ADF) Welding Helmets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Shade</li><li>Variable Shade</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fixed shade welding helmets have a fixed shade level, usually around shade 10, that does not change during welding. Variable shade welding helmets, on the other hand, allow welders to adjust the shade level according to the specific task at hand, typically ranging from shade 9 to shade 13. Variable shade helmets offer more flexibility and customization for different welding processes and environments. Both types of helmets serve the same purpose of protecting the welder's eyes and face from harmful UV and infrared rays during welding.</p></p>
