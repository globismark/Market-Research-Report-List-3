<p><h1>Radioactive Stent Market Size, Market Trends, and Growth Outlook forecasted for period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Radioactive Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A radioactive stent is a medical device used in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, particularly in the case of coronary artery disease. These stents are coated with a radioactive material, usually gamma-emitting isotopes, to prevent restenosis of the blood vessel. The radiation emitted from the stent helps in inhibiting the excessive growth of cells in the affected artery, reducing the chances of re-narrowing.</p><p>The Radioactive Stent Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, coupled with the rising geriatric population globally, is driving the growth of the radioactive stent market. Technological advancements in the healthcare industry have also led to the development of innovative radioactive stents with improved efficacy and safety profiles.</p><p>Moreover, the growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is further boosting the demand for radioactive stents. Additionally, favorable reimbursement policies and increasing healthcare expenditure in emerging economies are expected to propel the market growth. Overall, the radioactive stent market is witnessing steady growth, with the potential for further expansion in the coming years.</p></p>
