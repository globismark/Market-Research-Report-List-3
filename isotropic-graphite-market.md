<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isotropic Graphite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CIP Method</li><li>Vibration Molding Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Isotropic Graphite Market consists of two main types - the CIP Method and the Vibration Molding Method. In the CIP Method, Isotropic Graphite is compressed into shape under high pressure using a Cold Isostatic Press, resulting in a dense and uniform structure. On the other hand, the Vibration Molding Method involves vibrating the graphite powder to mold it into shape, creating a more cost-effective option with slightly less density. Both methods cater to different customer preferences and applications in the Isotropic Graphite market.</p></p>
