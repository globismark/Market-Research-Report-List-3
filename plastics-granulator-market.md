<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastics Granulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Beside-the-press Granulators</li><li>Central Granulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Beside-the-press granulators are compact machines designed to be placed beside injection molding machines to grind sprues, runners, and rejected parts directly at the injection molding machine. They are ideal for processing smaller amounts of plastic materials. On the other hand, central granulators are larger machines that can process larger volumes of scrap plastic from various sources, such as extrusion, blow molding, and thermoforming. They are typically used in centralized recycling facilities or large manufacturing plants. Both types of granulators play a crucial role in plastic recycling and waste reduction efforts.</p></p>
