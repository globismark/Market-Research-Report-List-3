<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Roughness Measurement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Noncontact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface roughness measurement market can be categorized into contact and noncontact methods. Contact methods involve physical contact with the surface being measured using a probing device, such as a stylus profilometer, to determine the roughness characteristics. Noncontact methods, on the other hand, utilize optical or laser technologies to measure surface roughness without directly touching the surface. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, with contact methods offering higher precision but potentially causing surface damage, while noncontact methods are quicker and safer for delicate surfaces.</p></p>
