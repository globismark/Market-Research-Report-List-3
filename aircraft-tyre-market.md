<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Tyre</li><li>Front Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft tyre market can be divided into two main types: main tyres and front tyres. Main tyres are larger and designed to support the weight of the aircraft during takeoff, landing, and taxiing. They are typically made of more durable materials to withstand the higher levels of stress. Front tyres, on the other hand, are smaller and are primarily responsible for steering the aircraft while on the ground. Both types of tyres play a crucial role in the safe operation of an aircraft.</p></p>
