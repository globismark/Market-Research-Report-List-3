<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Endoscopy Insufflators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Gas Preheating Function</li><li>With Gas Preheating Function</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronic endoscopy insufflators are used in medical procedures to inflate the gastrointestinal tract for better visualization. Insufflators without gas preheating function release room temperature gas directly into the body during endoscopy. On the other hand, insufflators with gas preheating function heat the gas before it is released, making the procedure more comfortable for the patient. Both types of insufflators are important tools in endoscopy procedures, providing different levels of functionality and patient comfort.</p></p>
