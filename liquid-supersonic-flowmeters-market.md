<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Supersonic Flowmeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact Supersonic Flowmeters</li><li>Contact Supersonic Flowmeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid supersonic flowmeters are devices used to measure the flow rate of liquid substances in various industries. There are two main types of liquid supersonic flowmeters: non-contact supersonic flowmeters and contact supersonic flowmeters. Non-contact supersonic flowmeters use ultrasonic technology to measure flow rate without coming into direct contact with the liquid. Contact supersonic flowmeters, on the other hand, utilize physical sensors or probes that come into direct contact with the liquid to measure flow rate. Both types of flowmeters are critical for ensuring accurate measurement and control of liquid flow in industrial processes.</p></p>
