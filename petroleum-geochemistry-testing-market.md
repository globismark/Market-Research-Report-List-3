<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum Geochemistry Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laboratory Based</li><li>In-field Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Petroleum geochemistry testing can be divided into two main types: laboratory based and in-field based. Laboratory based testing involves bringing samples back to a specialized facility for analysis, allowing for more detailed and comprehensive results. In-field based testing, on the other hand, involves conducting analysis on-site or in real-time, providing quicker results but potentially sacrificing some depth and accuracy. Both types of testing play an important role in understanding the composition and characteristics of petroleum resources.</p></p>
