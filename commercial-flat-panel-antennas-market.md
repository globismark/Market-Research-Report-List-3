<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Flat Panel Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronically Steered</li><li>Mechanically Steered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial flat panel antennas are commonly divided into two main types: electronically steered and mechanically steered. Electronically steered antennas use electronic signals to steer and adjust the direction of the antenna beams, allowing for quicker and more precise adjustments. On the other hand, mechanically steered antennas rely on physical movement to adjust the direction of the antenna beams. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, with electronically steered antennas offering faster response times and more flexibility, while mechanically steered antennas may be more reliable in certain conditions.</p></p>
