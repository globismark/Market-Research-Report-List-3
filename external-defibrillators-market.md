<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automated External Defibrillators (AED)</li><li>Manual External Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>External defibrillators are divided into two main types - Automated External Defibrillators (AED) and Manual External Defibrillators. AEDs are designed to be user-friendly and can automatically analyze the heart rhythm of a patient to deliver an electrical shock if necessary. Manual External Defibrillators require trained professionals to analyze the heart rhythm themselves and manually deliver the shock. Both types are vital tools in saving lives during sudden cardiac arrest emergencies, but AEDs are more commonly used in public settings due to their simplicity and ease of use.</p></p>
