<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FPGA Evaluation Board Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SRAM</li><li>FLASH</li></ul></p>
<p><p>FPGA evaluation boards come in two main types: SRAM-based and FLASH-based. SRAM-based boards feature volatile memory that allows for reprogramming without the need to power down the device. FLASH-based boards, on the other hand, use non-volatile memory, retaining programmed data even when power is off. Both types cater to different needs and preferences of users, offering flexibility in development and testing of FPGA designs. The choice between SRAM and FLASH boards depends on the specific requirements of the project at hand.</p></p>
