<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overhead Transmission Line Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical Fiber Composite Overhead Ground Wire</li><li>Steel Strand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The overhead transmission line market consists of two main types: Optical Fiber Composite Overhead Ground Wire (OPGW) and Steel Strand. OPGW is designed for communication purposes, combining optical fibers with conventional ground wires to transmit data alongside electricity. Steel Strand, on the other hand, is primarily used for structural support in overhead transmission lines. While OPGW provides additional benefits such as enhanced communication capabilities, Steel Strand is essential for the physical integrity and reliability of the transmission line infrastructure.</p></p>
